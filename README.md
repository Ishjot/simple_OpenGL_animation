# Simple OpenGL Animation
Project #2 for CS180, Fall 2016, UCSB, Ishjot Walia

#####*Requirements*
This code was written and tested on the instructional machines at CSIL at UCSB and on macOS Sierra 10.12 using XCode, and cannot be confirmed to work on any other machine. In order to run this code please install both the OpenGL and GLUT libraries to link to while compiling. Insturctions on installation can be found [here](https://www.opengl.org/wiki/Getting_Started "Getting Started OpenGL") and [here](https://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/ "GLUT Homepage") respectively. It may be required to not use the makefile and compile and link manually.

#####*Usage*
1. `make all`
2. `./anim_cubes`

#####*Example Screenshot*
If everything went well with the setup and excecution of the code, you should see something like the following image, but animated! Feel free to use your mouse to move around in the scene.

######*Future Work*
This is a very simple OpenGL project. Next steps could include allowing movement in more than just the xy plane, texture mapping for the cubes and numbers, and click-to-drag functionality for the objects in the scene.
